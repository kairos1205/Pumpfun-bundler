# 🚀 Pump.Fun Bundler (PumpSwap Migration Bot)

**Pump.Fun Bundler** is an advanced tooling solution for automating token launches, bundling, and onchain migration between **Pump.Fun** and **PumpSwap** — enabling **buy**, **migrate**, and **sell** operations within a single transaction.

Whether you're bundling wallets, migrating to PumpSwap, or automating trading strategies — this tool handles it all, including wallet profile generation, LUT creation, complex sell logic, and real-time performance optimization.

## 🧭 How It Works

> **End-to-end workflow** from launch to sell, automated.

1. **Wallet Creation**
   Generate and assign wallets (keypairs) for bundling and buying.

2. **LUT Management**

   * Create onchain **Look-Up Table (LUT)**
   * Extend LUT with relevant program addresses
   * Simulate TXs for bundle assembly

3. **Pool Launch (Bundled)**

   * Create metadata + token pool
   * Include 3-5 buy transactions (up to 28 wallets)
   * Finalize and submit bundle

4. **Token Selling (Optional)**

   * Sell tokens from 24 wallets simultaneously
   * Optional: gather proceeds into main wallet
